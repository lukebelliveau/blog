In my experience, the primary reason to start a programming blog is to introduce
yourself to a handful of new technical problems, get frustrated, and forget about
the blog in about a week. Before I forget about this blog, I'm gonna show you
how to do this:

<SandpackSnippet>

```tsx
export default () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>Play with me!</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

</SandpackSnippet>

By writing markdown like this:

````jsx
<SandpackSnippet>

```tsx
export default () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>Play with me!</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

</SandpackSnippet>
````
