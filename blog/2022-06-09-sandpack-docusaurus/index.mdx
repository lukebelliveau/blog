_note: after writing this, I found a more robust explanation done by Juwon Owoseni at LogRocket. you can read that [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-interactive-blog-with-react-sandpack/)!_

In my experience, the primary reason to start a programming blog is to introduce
yourself to a handful of new technical problems, solve some of them, then forget about
the blog in about a week. Before I forget about this blog, I'm gonna show you
how to do this:

<SandpackEditor>

```tsx
export default () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>Play with me!</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

</SandpackEditor>

<br />

By writing markdown (technically `.mdx`) like this:

````jsx
<SandpackEditor>

```tsx
export default () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>Play with me!</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

</SandpackEditor>
````

### Inspiration & Alternatives

It's important to me that the markdown files I write these blogs in are
relatively portable - ideally if I get sick of Docusaurus, I can copy the very
[`.mdx`](https://mdxjs.com/) file I'm writing in now, and take it somewhere else. This ruled out the approach I see in a lot of places,
where blogs will render an `iframe` to embed a code editor hosted on StackBlitz, CodeSandbox, or somewhere else (like this):

```jsx
<iframe
  src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-ktczzd?embed=1&file=App.tsx"
  width="100%"
  height="400px"
/>
```

<iframe
  src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-ktczzd?embed=1&file=App.tsx"
  width="100%"
  height="400px"
/>

I've more or less achieved this, as long as CodeSandbox (the makers of Sandpack) don't disappear any time soon.

While it's true that the Sandpack editor won't show up without a connection to CodeSandbox servers, I get to keep all of the code with me, living in or alongside
the markdown files.

This approach was inspired by the ReactJS docs. (At this time of writing they're
the beta docs for Hooks, with loads of interactive examples)

### Enter the Sandpack

[Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/) is a library by
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). It provides some React components to render
an editable sandbox right in the browser. Using the basic sandbox component, you can
get something like this with barely any code:

<SandpackEditor dependencies={{
  "@codesandbox/sandpack-react": "latest"
}}>

```tsx
import { Sandpack } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export default () => <Sandpack template="react-ts" />;
```

</SandpackEditor>

_The left pane loads Sandpack, the top-right pane is the editor_ loaded by _Sandpack, the bottom right pane is output of the Sandpack editor. Play around!_

Sandbox offers loads of great customization options, which you can read about in the [docs](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/getting-started/install).
One thing they don't offer out-of-the-box is a way to pass a Markdown code block
as a child, and render them as files, as shown above.

Here, I'll show you how to do this.
You can even create multiple files as children, and have them editable as such:

````jsx
<SandpackEditor>

```tsx Index.tsx active
import App from './App'

export default () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>Play with me!</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```tsx App.tsx
const App = () => {
  return <div>I'm the app, but I'm in a different file!</div>
}
```

</SandpackEditor>
````

renders as:

<SandpackEditor>

```tsx Index.tsx active
import App from "./App";

export default () => {
  return <App />;
};
```

```tsx App.tsx
const App = () => {
  return <div>I'm the App component, but I'm in a different file!</div>;
};

export default App;
```

</SandpackEditor>

### Creating our `SandpackEditor` component

We will extend the baseline `Sandpack` component to work for this use case.
I want our custom component to do two things:

- Accept a string of children "component files", except instead of real files they're markdown code blocks
- Understand what dependencies are needed to run the snippet, so `Sandpack` can download the dependencies on a per-example basis

This requires some nontrivial knowledge about MDX & React elements, along with what I assume was a fair bit of trial & error.
Thankfully, the folks working on the ReactJS docs figured this out first, so I didn't have to. Here's what our `SandpackEditor`
component looks like:

```jsx
import { Sandpack } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";
import { createFileMap } from "./createFileMap";

const SandpackEditor = ({
  children,
  dependencies = {},
}: {
  children: JSX.Element,
  dependencies: { [key: string]: string },
}) => {
  const files = createFileMap(children);

  return (
    <Sandpack
      template="react-ts"
      files={files}
      options={{
        showNavigator: true,
      }}
      customSetup={{
        dependencies,
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

Pretty simple, right? There's a fair bit of magic going on in that `createFileMap` function, which
I unceremoniously stole from the [ReactJS docs repo on Github](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org).

I'll let you parse the code, but here's the gist of it:

- convert the `children` JSX element to an array of children
- from this array, create an object keyed on the filename, with the values holding other properties (like the code, and if the file is active/hidden)

The output of this function is an object ready to be passed as the Sandpack [`files` prop](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/api/react/interfaces/SandpackProps#files). Cool!

```tsx
import type { SandpackFile } from "@codesandbox/sandpack-react";

export const createFileMap = (
  children: JSX.Element
): Record<string, SandpackFile> => {
  let codeSnippets = React.Children.toArray(children) as React.ReactElement[];

  return codeSnippets.reduce(
    (result: Record<string, SandpackFile>, codeSnippet: React.ReactElement) => {
      if (codeSnippet.props.mdxType !== "pre") {
        return result;
      }
      const { props } = codeSnippet.props.children;
      let filePath; // path in the folder structure
      let fileHidden = false; // if the file is available as a tab
      let fileActive = false; // if the file tab is shown by default

      if (props.metastring) {
        const [name, ...params] = props.metastring.split(" ");
        filePath = "/" + name;
        if (params.includes("hidden")) {
          fileHidden = true;
        }
        if (params.includes("active")) {
          fileActive = true;
        }
      } else {
        if (props.className === "language-js") {
          filePath = "/App.js";
        } else if (props.className === "language-ts") {
          filePath = "/App.tsx";
        } else if (props.className === "language-tsx") {
          filePath = "/App.tsx";
        } else if (props.className === "language-css") {
          filePath = "/styles.css";
        } else {
          throw new Error(
            `Code block is missing a filename: ${props.children}`
          );
        }
      }
      if (result[filePath]) {
        throw new Error(
          `File ${filePath} was defined multiple times. Each file snippet should have a unique path name`
        );
      }
      result[filePath] = {
        code: props.children as string,
        hidden: fileHidden,
        active: fileActive,
      };

      return result;
    },
    {}
  );
};
```

We now have a `SandpackEditor` component that's ready to be dropped into our
`.mdx` files. Sweet. Last step: add it to Docusaurus!

### Add to Docusaurus

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a popular static-site generator for generating
documentation and blogs. I chose it because it is the first piece of blog-generation technology
that hasn't made me quit in frustration before I started writing. Seriously, it's pretty great.

Anyway, the default generator for Docusaurus will create many folders, one of them
`src/components`. Put your new component in there. I did it like this:

```
.
└── src/
    └── components/
        └── SandpackEditor/
            ├── SandpackEditor.tsx
            └── createFileMap.ts
```

Now, we're going to add our component to Docusaurus' global scope so we can
drop it into any of our `.mdx` files without any import statements. you can read more about Docusaurus MDX global scope [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/react#mdx-component-scope).

You may or may not have a file at `/src/theme/MDXComponents.js` (I didn't). If you don't create one, and make it look like this:

```js
// Import the original mapper
import MDXComponents from "@theme-original/MDXComponents";
import SandpackEditor from "@site/src/components/SandpackEditor/SandpackEditor";

export default {
  // Re-use the default mapping
  ...MDXComponents,
  // Map the "SandpackEditor" tag to our <SandpackEditor /> component!
  // `SandpackEditor` will receive all props that were passed to `SandpackEditor` in MDX
  SandpackEditor: SandpackEditor,
};
```

Voila! If all goes well, you should be able to use `.mdx` files with your new `<SandpackEditor />` component, just like [this very file does](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukebelliveau/blog/main/blog/2022-06-09-sandpack-docusaurus/index.mdx)!
